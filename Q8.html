      <h3>Education</h3><p>Although virtual reality may be experiencing slow adoption in the consumer market, one area where it seems to have truly untapped potential is in the classroom where virtual worlds could help students visualize and learn about history, science, and culture in an unprecedented fashion. In Taiwan, Oculus is working with the Taiwan Internet and E-Commerce Association (TiEA) to put headsets in libraries and museums so members of the public can interact with exhibits and visual learning apps free of charge. In Japan, Oculus is focusing on applying VR to aid with online education and so-called distance learning, which is the teaching of students who cannot be physically present in the classroom

      <h3>Politics</h3>
<p>360º video is allowing people to be right there for campaign events. It provides the ability to place a virtual reality user directly into the middle of these events they wouldn’t normally have access to. This is cultivated by the immediacy and intimacy of the experience. The power of VR as an election campaign medium could be used as a tool for cultural and political empathy. This means connecting with potential voters in a personal way, and using this to sway votes. One example was during the 2016 Democratic Primary. The Bernie Sanders campaign became the first in history to appear in virtual reality. One of his fundraising events was recorded with a 360º camera and shared with the world. Los Angeles based virtual reality studio, Virtuality Lab conducted this shoot. VR users could put on a headset and observe Sanders at the event giving his speech.
