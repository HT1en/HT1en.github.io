    <p class="text_column">Hardware would need to change to make the experience more surreal for users and the software as well. With new technology being developed everyday the hardware would be getting better and VR could be used in many different areas in society. Qualcomm's new XR2 chip sounds powerful: It's a VR/AR-specialized variation of the company's newest Snapdragon 865 chip. Graphics should be twice as good as what's on the current Oculus Quest, and much higher display resolution should mean crisper visuals.The wildest and weirdest part of the new chipset, though, is its support for seven cameras at once. Cameras are crucial in VR and AR: VR cameras track movement in the world, such as hand gestures and eye tracking. Qualcomm's Swart sees more simultaneous cameras allowing for more face tracking, with cameras able to track facial movements, lips and microexpressions. </p>
